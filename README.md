# **Stack Bases Evaluator**
### This the third assignment in the course 'Principles of Software Design'
-----

###### **Given this is part of a series of assignments from a course, I do not condone plagarism. Please don't copy my code and claim as yours.**
-----

## **Assignment Details**
- Purpose: Utilize the Stack class from the second assignment and create an evaluator using the infix to postfix algorithm. The Command Pattern will be used to evaluate the postfix expression and the Abstract Factory will be used to create commands.
- Given: Shells files were not given in this assignment. 
- Notes: Implementation of functions were my own logic.

## **How To Run Program**
- Download Repository
- In Command Line:
  - 'make run' : compiles and runs program (edit driver.cpp to test methods)
  - 'make clean' : to remove additional files during compilation
-----

## **Examples**
- ### There should be a spaces between each token. Press 'enter' to evaluate input expression.
----- 
- Example 1: Demonstrates the capability to handle positive and negative integers.

## **Addition Notes**
###### This was originally compiled using [MPC](https://github.com/DOCGroup/MPC). I made my own Makefile to make things easier.
